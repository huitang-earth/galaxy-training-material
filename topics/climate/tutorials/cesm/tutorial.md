zenodo_link: ''
questions:
- What is an Earth System Model?
- What is the Community Earth System Model (CESM)?
- Why using CESM?
- What are the different components of CESM?
- What is a control experiment?
- How to visualize CESM control model outputs?

## Get data

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Data upload
>
> 1. Create a new history for this tutorial. If you are not inspired, you can name it *cesm* for example...
>    {% include snippets/create_new_history.md %}
> 2. Import the file from [Zenodo](XXX) or from the shared data library
>
>    ```
>    https://zenodo.org/record/XXXX/files/XXX
>    ```
>
>    {% include snippets/import_via_link.md %}
>    {% include snippets/import_from_data_library.md %}
>
> 3. Check that the datatype is **XXX**
>
>    Files you uploaded are in XXX format. In Galaxy, Datatypes are, by default, automatically guessed. 
>
>    {% include snippets/change_datatype.md datatype="datatypes" %}
>
> 4. Rename Datasets
>
>    As "https://zenodo.org/record/XXX/files/XXX" is not a beautiful name and can give errors for some tools, it is a good practice to change the dataset name by something more meaningfull. For example by removing `https://zenodo.org/record/XXX/files/` to obtain `XXX`.
>
>    {% include snippets/rename_dataset.md %}
>
> 5. Add a tag to the dataset corresponding to `cesm`
>
>    {% include snippets/add_tag.md %}
